# MyLife
Overall Roadmap for the MyCloud, MyDroid and ITPS Projects

This repository is just a centralized place with links to each of the components in the "MyLife" Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project meant to eliminate dependance on propriatary clouds.

The following repositories are currently part of the MyLife project:
* [Identity Transfer Protocol (ITPS)](https://github.com/varasys/ITPS) - Secure (secure networking protocol)
* [MyCloud](https://github.com/varasys/MyCloud) (personal cloud)
    * [paczfs](https://github.com/varasys/paczfs) (ArchLinux on ZFS root filesystem)
* [MyDroid](https://github.com/varasys/MyDroid) (fork of Android with proper security model)
* MyChat (initial chat application meant to popularize the MyCloud concept) (because let's face it, we are all sick of switching chat apps every two years and would appreciate a secure and private infrastructure upon which developers can build various UIs for people to choose from) (basically, standardize a protocol like smtp did for email (except make it secure from the ground up), and unleash developers to build whatever front-ends they want)
